## 🚀 Project Overview

This console application is a **Cybersecurity Awareness Bot** developed in C#. When launched, it:

- Plays a **voice greeting** (`Greeting.wav`) to welcome the user.
- Displays **ASCII art** header for visual flair.
- Prompts for the user’s name and personalizes responses.
- Offers a menu of cybersecurity topics (password safety, phishing, safe browsing, etc.).
- Validates input and handles unknown requests gracefully.
- Simulates a conversational “typing” effect for immersive UX.

This assignment builds your understanding of:

1. Console I/O and user interaction
2. Dependency Injection with **Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection**
3. Asynchronous programming patterns in C#
4. Basic string manipulation, collections, and randomization
5. Structured, modular code design (single responsibility principle)

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- Windows with audio support (for voice greeting)
- (Optional) Visual Studio 2022 or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with C# extension

---

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/CyberSecurityBot.git
   cd CyberSecurityBot
   ```
2. **Restore NuGet packages** (DI package is required)
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```
3. **Build the solution**
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```
4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project ./CyberSecurityBot.csproj
   ```

## 🎮 How to Use

1. Launch the app – you’ll hear a friendly voice greeting if `Greeting.wav` is present.
2. ASCII art logo appears, followed by a prompt: *“Good day! What’s your name?”*
3. After entering your name, you’ll see a numbered menu of cybersecurity topics.
4. Enter the number corresponding to your topic to get practical tips.
5. Type **exit** or select the last menu item to quit gracefully.

## ✅ Continuous Integration (CI)

This repo is configured with **GitHub Actions** to:

- **Build** on every push
- **Run** a simple syntax check (no unit tests yet)

> **Hint:** Add your own tests and update the CI workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

---

## 📈 Version Control & Commits

A minimum of **three meaningful commits** is required:

1. **Initial commit:** Project scaffolding & DI setup
2. **Greeting & UI:** Voice greeting, ASCII art, and typing effect
3. **Core logic:** In-memory responses, menu navigation, and input validation

---

## 🙌 Next Steps (Part 2)

- **Dynamic responses** based on keyword detection
- **Memory & recall** (remember user preferences)
- **Sentiment detection** to adjust tone
- **Unit testing** for core services
